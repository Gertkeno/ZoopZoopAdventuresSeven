  <h2>Zoop Zoop</h2>
  <img class="biopic" src="img/zoopzoop.png"/>
  <p>
  Birthday July 21st born in San Antonio Texas<br/><br/>
  <b>Zoop Zoop</b> he is kind of a cry baby sometimes but is super brave and always the star of the show. Zoop zoop has that indistinguishable quality that makes a star.
  Zoop zoop can be a little emotionally needy but only because he loves to have fun and connect with other bees. He pissed off Dick dastardly 26 years ago while rudely interrupting his retirement speech during a picnic, his dummy thick wings were buzzing so buzz loudly while he was partaking in his favorite activity of collecting pollins. He was too distracted to see there was a community event being held and didn't notice until it was too late. He wasn't trying to interrupt but Dick took it as a personal slight due to Zoops reputation for stealing the show. Although Zoop apologized via edible arrangement, Dick has a tendency to hold grudges.
  Zoop zoop now spends his days defending his meadows and collecting delicious pollins
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Zoopzoops favorite food is big mac</li>
    <li>Zoopzoops favorite color is royale blue</li>
    <li>ZoopZoop hates lettuce (its too watery)</li>
    <li>ZoopZoop talks too loudly in restaurants</li>

  <b>Berries</b> She is Pemdas older sister, she is very cheerful and studious but can be a bit reckless despite seeming graceful, berries is kinda clutzy sometimes. Berries is a risk taking curious adventrtpt who can sometimes be a bit over confident and get herself into trouble. Luckily her sister pemdas is usually nearby to bail her out of trouble.

Berries and zoop zopp get a long well but can be a bit competitive with each other, not used to sharing the spotlight.

  <img class="biopic" src="img/dick.png"/>
  <p>
  Birthday Jan 1st place of birth: streets of paris<br/><br/>
  <b>Dick Dastardly Duck</b> really just a business man with a grudge for those damn bees, why they hell are they everywhere? Why thy always around buzz buzz and shit? Dick has a tendancy to be a bit manipulative and has a hard time letting things go. He was once in the news paper for being the first person in his town to have a computer in his house, he didnt really know how to use it and still has it somewhere. He returns to the meadow daily to rue the moment when his retirement announcement was destroyed. He tries to smash flowers to prevent the annoying buzzing sounds that cause terror and destruction to all who must bear the horrendous noises.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>DDD's Fave food is hotdogs with ketchup (ew)</li>
    <li>DDD's fave color is GREEN </li>
    <li>DDD hates those damn bees</li>
    <li>DDD secretly has been on the website BEES4SALE.com but clears his browser history after visiting. He hasnt bought anything, he really doesn't get what the site is for actually.. (browser via mac book air)</li>
